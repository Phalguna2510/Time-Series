# Time-Series
A time series is a sequence of data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals, often in equal spacing. Time series analysis involves understanding the underlying patterns within the data, such as trends (long-term increase or decrease), seasonality (regular variations due to seasonal factors), and cyclical patterns (irregular fluctuations influenced by economic cycles). The goal is often to model these patterns to make forecasts or gain insights into the temporal dynamics of the observed phenomenon. Examples of time series data include daily temperature readings, stock market prices, and monthly sales figures.
# ARIMA
The Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) model combines two fundamental components: autoregression (AR) and moving average (MA). The autoregressive part models the current value of the series as a function of its previous values, capturing the relationship between an observation and a number of lagged observations. The moving average part models the current value as a function of past error terms, smoothing out the noise by considering past forecast errors. ARMA models are suitable for stationary time series data, where the properties like mean and variance remain constant over time. The model is defined by two parameters: p (order of autoregression) and q (order of moving average), and it helps in understanding the dynamics of the time series and making forecasts based on past values and past errors.
# Exponential Smoothing
Exponential Smoothing is a time series forecasting method that applies weighted averages of past observations, where the weights decay exponentially as the observations get older. This technique emphasizes more recent observations while giving exponentially decreasing weights to older data points. There are different types of exponential smoothing models: Simple Exponential Smoothing for data without trends or seasonality, Holtâ€™s Linear Trend Model for data with trends, and Holt-Winters Seasonal Model for data with both trend and seasonality. The core idea is to smooth the time series data to identify the underlying pattern and forecast future values by considering both the level and trend components, and, in the case of Holt-Winters, the seasonal component. Exponential smoothing is effective for making short-term forecasts and is computationally efficient.
# Project
In this project, we aimed to predict real-world data, such as Power-Consumption, using a time series dataset. The dataset did not require much preprocessing as it was a clean dataset. We worked on finding out if the data had any seasonality and found that it had daily, monthly and weekly seasonality. We evaluated the performance of four types of models: Linear Regression, Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, and SARIMA models. Finally, we found a dataset that shows the power generated from different sources in Africa(as our power-consumption dataset was based in Africa) such as coal, hydro-power,etc,.With this information we aim to find the carbon emission from each non-renewable sources by using the power forecast from our models.
